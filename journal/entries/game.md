# Game Concept: Rhythm Game

### What genre will your game be?
The game will be a rhythm game where players press keys in time with the circular notes rising from the bottom top of screen

### What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?
The objective is to score points by hitting notes at the right time, 
players earn points for hitting notes and lose points for missing them. 
The game can have a win condition based on surviving until the end of the song, or getting high score idk if ill do something with score

### How will the player interact with the game?
Players will use 4 keys, like  D,F,J,K, to match falling notes. The game will give feedback for hits or misses.

### What features will you include in your MVP?
- Notes rise from bottom of the screen
- A way for players to press keys to interact with the notes
- A scoring system to track hits and misses
- Basic visual feedback for player actions
- sync the notes to a simple rhythm, because i dont want this to be too impossible

### possible later features, may be hard, idk but ill try
- adding levels with increasing difficulty
- High-score tracking.
- combo
- ability to change keybinds
- option to switch to gameplay with more keys
- sync notes to music, if possible
