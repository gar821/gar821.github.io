# My website

## Reflection paragraph 1

I examined [Apple](https://apple.com), [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.com), and [Micro Center](https://microcenter.com). Apple is pretty minimalist and has good quality imagges, Best buy is pretty user friendly, and Micro center has interesting layout. My website isn't too comparable but I guess I had some decent images, so..

## Reflection paragraph 2

WordPress was hard at first, so much things that you can navigate, made me feel lost. But only a few things were important, in the free trial, customization is pretty limited, but it still is manageable in order to make a functioning website.
