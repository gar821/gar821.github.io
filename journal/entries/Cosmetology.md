## Development reflection


- Collaboration & code sharing
	- We used shared repo and worked on different pages
	- Had to make sure links & styles matched on other pages
- Pulling & merging
	- pulling and merging was easy & went well
- Branch-based development
	- we each worked on our own branch before pushing to main
	- pull requests helped for seeing others' code
